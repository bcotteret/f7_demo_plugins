# Framework7 -Vue.js Demo App % cordova plugins

This is solely a minimal app to get running F7 and cordova plugins:

* Camera
* Barcode Scan (Phonegap plugin)

## Scope & requirements

This App is targeted for Android 8.1+, no IOS tested.
You should have Cordova (and Android Studio) and Framework7 CLI installed.
Read the [Docs](https://framework7.io/cli/installation.html) on how to do this. Further instructions below.

## NPM Scripts

* ðŸ”¥ `start` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `dev` - run development server
* ðŸ“± `build-prod-cordova-android` - build cordova Android app
* ðŸ“± `run-android` -  Build Android app and deploy to device

## Testing

I strongly recommend you deploy on a physical device or at least within an emulator (Android studio or so).
Running the App within browser won't actually let you use the camera / scanner.
